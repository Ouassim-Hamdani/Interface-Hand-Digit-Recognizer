# AI University Project: Classifying Hand-written Digits

This project develops an Ensembled deep learning model to classify hand-written digits

**Key Features:**

* Implements VGG19 & ResNET50 finetunned models with a Trained CNN model.
* Achieves an accuracy of **99.20%** on the test dataset.
* Provides insights into the key factors from data data loading all the way to deployment.

**Installation:**

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Ouassim-Hamdani/Interface-Hand-Digit-Recognizer` or extract zip.
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `make install`  if you have `make` installed.
3. Either : 
    - Run the main script: `python src/main.py` or `make run-main`.
